# NPM Command Line Client

DozerJS has an [npm available](https://www.npmjs.org/package/dozerjs) to make
creating new instances simple. To get started install the npm globally:

`npm install dozerjs -g`

Then simply run the `dozerjs` npm via the following:

`dozerjs create NewProject`

Which will create the project with all neccesary assets and dependencies in the
directory `./NewProject`.
